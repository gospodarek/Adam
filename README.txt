============================================

Thank you for your purchase! Below are descriptions for each of
the files and folders included in this .ZIP file:

README.txt
	The document you are currently reading.

xhtmlcss/
	Contains the tableless XHTML/CSS layouts and the GIF/JPEG
	images they require. If you plan to use this version of
	the template, these are the files you will edit and upload
	to your website.

	Note: Older HTML editors, as well as those without adequate
	support for CSS, may not work correctly with this version of
	the template. If this affects you, we recommend using the
	tables-based layouts instead (see below).

html/
	Contains the tables-based HTML layouts and the GIF/JPEG
	images they require. If you plan to use this version of
	the template, these are the files you will edit and upload
	to your website.

psd/
	Contains the Adobe Photoshop .PSD source files for each
	of the template's layouts. You can edit these files to
	make more extensive changes to the template, but you do
	not have to upload them to your website.

	Note: These .PSD files are provided 'sliced' using the
	Photoshop slice tool. Both the XHTML/CSS and HTML versions
	of the template utilize the same PSD files and slices.

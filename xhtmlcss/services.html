					<h2 class="title">Services</h2>
					<p>The A.G.F.M. portfolio of services focuses its efforts on the following three areas: Business
Services, Venture Capital, and Knowledge Sharing.</p>
					<div id="services" class="style1">
					<h2>Business Services</h2>
					<h3>Financial Reporting</h3>
					<p>A.G.F.M. has the specific skill set to not only
deliver timely and accurate financial statements to executive management, but more
importantly, interpret those statements to aid management in evaluation and strategic
decision making. Further, A.G.F.M. has the resources and knowledge to effectively
remove the financial accounting and reporting duties from the company, enabling
management to focus its time instead on the business operations.</p>
					<h3>Efficiency Architect Engagement</h3>
						<p>The Efficiency Architect Engagement is the flagship service offered by A.G.F.M. in alliance with CMJ Properties and Investments, LLC.  It is a holistic consulting service aimed at providing global efficiency solutions to small and mid-size enterprises.  The Engagement focuses on maximizing enterprise profitability and sustainability.</p>
						<p>Through an initial Pre-Engagement Interview, and subsequent completion of the proprietary Efficiency Architect Survey by the client, the Architects provide a customized Efficiency Architect Analysis detailing specific administrative and operational efficiency solutions. </p>
						<p>The Analysis is a multiple-page roadmap aimed to deliver specific and actionable solutions for the client, without overwhelming management with non-value added recommendations.  It focuses on the Core Pillars of Business Sustainability developed by the Architects.</p>
						<p>Once the Analysis is completed, and an Efficiency Architect Consultation is conducted with the client to assure full comprehension, the Architects may perform subsequent recurring meetings to aid in the implementation of the solutions. </p>
						<h3>Business Plan Creation</h3>
						<p>A.G.F.M. has the unique experience and expertise to create a top-tier business plan for
small and mid-size enterprises. Whether a budding entrepreneur looking for initial seed
money or a seasoned business looking to expand to new territories, a business plan is a
critical element to the short-term success and long-term sustainability of any enterprise.
It effectively and efficiently communicates the comprehensive plan of the enterprise,
proving the diligence of a professional, and thereby opening doors to financial capital or
other sources of professional opportunity.</p>
						<h3>Public Company Efficiency</h3>
						<p>Applying years of experience and knowledge over compliance with the strict regulations mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), A.G.F.M. offers the expertise over the following areas:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 – Mastery of all facets of 404 compliance stemming from documenting, implementing, and testing to process reviewing and improving</a></li>
							<li>GAAP and SEC Financial Reporting Compliance – Expertise over periodic financial reporting requirements required by regulation S-X and S-K of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934</li>
							<li>Technical issue interpretation – Ability to research, opine, and document the conclusion of technical accounting transactions in accordance with FASB’s recently adapted Accounting Standards Codification</li>
						</ul>
						
					<h2>Venture Capital</h2>
						<p>In 2011, A.G.F.M. officially entered the world of Venture Capital.  Through its vast network of angel investors and other business leaders, A.G.F.M. and its affiliates have access to an undisclosed amount of capital available as seed money for innovative and ground-breaking ideas and businesses.  By utilizing its substantial operational and administrative expertise, A.G.F.M. delivers both capital advancement and seasoned management knowledge in order to nurture an idea into a business or rapidly accelerate an existing business to new heights. </p>
						<p>A.G.F.M. leverages its Efficiency Architect Engagement (refer to “Efficiency Architect Engagement”) as a conduit to assess whether existing and/or potential clients are capable of exponential and explosive growth through further capital infusion.  If so, A.G.F.M. may choose to be that source of capital to carry a business idea into a business empire.  </p>
						
					<h2>Knowledge Sharing</h2>
						<p>As a service for those interested in learning more about the specific skill set of financial
experts, A.G.F.M. is capable of hosting several different educational seminars that suit
the request of its clients.</p>

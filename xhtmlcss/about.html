						<p><img src="images/subpage1_02.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="105" class="alignleft" /><strong>A.G. Financial Management, LLC</strong> (hereinafter “A.G.F.M.”) is a premier financial management firm specializing in global financial solutions for small and mid-size enterprises.</p>
						<p>Founded in 2007 out of Denver, Colorado USA, A.G.F.M. was built on the principle that the traditional financial models for small and mid-size enterprises no longer applied to the current economic and social business environment.  After several years of professional client-services with a globally recognized firm, the founder of A.G.F.M. identified bureaucratic inefficiencies and antiquated thought processes that materially increased the cost of its services and prevented it from adapting to its evolving client needs.</p>
						<p>As a result, A.G.F.M. set out to deliver a top tier professional service while maintaining a streamline business model that would allow it to quickly adapt to the evolving needs of its clients.  Further, A.G.F.M. would leverage today’s state-of-the-art technology to offer the latest advancements in professional service.</p>
